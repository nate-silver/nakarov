This is just a personal experiment and learning how malicious code can be injected into a legitimate Portable Executable (PE) file. 

The two methods of code injection that are used in this tool are:
- Injecting a new section into the PE
- Injecting code into existing code caves within the PE

Things to work on:
- XOR functionality is still WIP.
